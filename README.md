This project contains a web application called "Awesome Auto-Complete Text" that provides an auto-complete feature using the Trie data structure.

## Project Description

This application offers auto-complete suggestions to users based on the characters they type into a text input field. The auto-complete feature is implemented using the Trie data structure, which efficiently stores and retrieves words for real-time suggestions. Trie allows for fast prefix matching, making the auto-complete experience seamless and responsive.

## Trie Data Structure

A Trie (also known as Prefix Tree) is a tree-like data structure that efficiently stores a dynamic set of strings. It is particularly useful for auto-complete scenarios, as it allows for quick prefix matching. The Trie's performance advantage lies in its ability to minimize the number of comparisons required to find all words with a given prefix, resulting in faster retrieval and suggesting relevant options in real-time.

## Features
